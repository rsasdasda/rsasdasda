ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm currently a BS student at National Cheng Kung University (NCKU), with deep interests spanning several areas in computer science and technology:

- **Deep Learning & Computer Vision**: Iâ€™m particularly fascinated by convolutional neural networks (CNNs), object detection models, and generative adversarial networks (GANs). I love exploring how these techniques can be applied to complex real-world scenarios like autonomous driving, medical imaging, and even artistic generation.

- **Algorithm Design**: I enjoy tackling problems in graph theory, dynamic programming, and optimization. Iâ€™m constantly learning advanced algorithmic techniques to design more efficient and scalable solutions, with a particular focus on computational complexity and data structure optimization.

- **Computer Organization** & Architecture: I delve into the workings of RISC-V architecture and have a keen interest in CPU pipeline optimization, cache coherence, and parallel processing. Iâ€™m intrigued by how hardware design choices impact performance, efficiency, and the software running on top.

- **Quantum Programming**: I'm excited about the future of quantum computing! I explore quantum algorithms, such as Groverâ€™s and Shorâ€™s algorithms, and experiment with quantum programming languages like Qiskit. My goal is to understand how quantum computing can solve problems that are intractable for classical computers.

- **Compiler Systems**: Iâ€™m captivated by the compilerâ€™s role in translating high-level code into efficient machine code. I have experience with compiler optimization techniques, parsing algorithms, and intermediate representation (IR) generation, and Iâ€™m eager to dive deeper into advanced optimizations.
